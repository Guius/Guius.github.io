# Prioritisation Tool

# Attempt to make tool automating the process of prioritising tasks in to-do lists. 

# The prioritising criteria are time to finish action, deadline of action and importance of action

# Aim to build tool that processes all tasks to do and offers an ordered list of tasks to perform in order to optimise time
